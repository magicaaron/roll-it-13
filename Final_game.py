instructions: to begin decide on a score goal 
(eg: the first one to get a score of 50 wins).

for each round of the game, you win points by
rolling dice. The winner of the round is the one
who gets 13 or slightly less

if you win the round, then your score will increase
by the number of points you earned. If your first
roll of the dice is a double (eg both dice show a 3)
then your score will be double the number of points

if you lose the round, then you dont get any points.

if you and the computer tie (eg you both get a score of 11.)
then you will have 11 points added to your score .

your goal is to try get the target score before the computer
